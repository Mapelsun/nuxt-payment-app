# Project Details
Create a Nuxt project (Must be Nuxt 3 Project)

Implement the UI (You can only use Tailwind CSS and Nuxt UI)

Take the User's GPS coordinates, calculate the distance, and show it under the customer address.

When the Inspect button is clicked, a Popup should open. In that popup, let the user click a photo and store it as a Base64 Image string in a variable.

Once the image is clicked, a Toast message should be shown. And remember, make it a global component so it can be invoked from anywhere in the application.

Deploy the project in Vercel or Netlify.
